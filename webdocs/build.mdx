🏗️  Manage native iOS/Android builds through Capgo Cloud.

### <a id="build-request"></a> 🔹 **Request**

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest build request
```

Request a native build from Capgo Cloud.
This command will zip your project directory and upload it to Capgo for building.
The build will be processed and sent directly to app stores.
🔒 SECURITY: Credentials are never stored on Capgo servers. They are auto-deleted
   after build completion. Builds sent directly to stores - Capgo keeps nothing.
📋 PREREQUISITE: Save credentials first with:
   npx @capgo/cli build credentials save --appId <app-id> --platform <ios|android>

**Example:**

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest build request com.example.app --platform ios --path .
```

**Options:**

| Param          | Type          | Description          |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| **--path** | <code>string</code> | Path to the project directory to build (default: current directory) |
| **--platform** | <code>string</code> | Target platform: ios or android (required) |
| **--build-mode** | <code>string</code> | Build mode: debug or release (default: release) |
| **--build-config** | <code>string</code> | Additional build configuration as JSON string |
| **-a,** | <code>string</code> | API key to link to your account |
| **--supa-host** | <code>string</code> | Custom Supabase host URL (for self-hosting or Capgo development) |
| **--supa-anon** | <code>string</code> | Custom Supabase anon key (for self-hosting) |

### <a id="build-credentials"></a> 🔹 **Credentials**

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest build credentials
```

Manage build credentials stored locally on your machine.
🔒 SECURITY:
   - Credentials saved to ~/.capgo-credentials/credentials.json (local machine only)
   - When building, sent to Capgo but NEVER stored permanently
   - Auto-deleted from Capgo after build (max 24 hours)
   - Builds sent directly to app stores - Capgo keeps nothing
