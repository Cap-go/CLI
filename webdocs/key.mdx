🔐 Manage encryption keys for secure bundle distribution in Capgo Cloud, supporting end-to-end encryption with RSA and AES combination.

### <a id="key-save"></a> 🔹 **Save**

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest key save
```

💾 Save the public key in the Capacitor config, useful for CI environments.
Recommended not to commit the key for security.

**Example:**

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest key save --key ./path/to/key.pub
```

**Options:**

| Param          | Type          | Description          |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| **-f,** | <code>string</code> | Force generate a new one |
| **--key** | <code>string</code> | Key path to save in Capacitor config |
| **--key-data** | <code>string</code> | Key data to save in Capacitor config |

### <a id="key-create"></a> 🔨 **Create**

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest key create
```

🔨 Create a new encryption key pair for end-to-end encryption in Capgo Cloud.
Do not commit or share the private key; save it securely.
This command will create a new key pair with the name .capgo_key_v2 and .capgo_key_v2.pub in the root of the project.
The public key is used to decrypt the zip file in the mobile app.
The public key will also be stored in the capacitor config. This is the one used in the mobile app. The file is just a backup.
The private key is used to encrypt the zip file in the CLI.

**Example:**

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest key create
```

**Options:**

| Param          | Type          | Description          |
| -------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| **-f,** | <code>string</code> | Force generate a new one |

### <a id="key-delete_old"></a> 🗑️ **Delete_old**

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest key delete_old
```

🧹 Delete the old encryption key from the Capacitor config to ensure only the current key is used.

**Example:**

```bash
npx @capgo/cli@latest key delete_old
```
